\f0\fs24 \cf0 ExtremeValueFinder.m is part 1 of the programming assignment.\
Simply run the file in MATLAB or Octave accordingly:\
	1. Push run. The code with generate 4 random integers ranging from -20 to 20 and will serve 	    as the c, d, e, and f values in the 3rd degree polynomials, find the extrema, and return a 	    plot of the function.\
	2. Hit run another 3 times, or how ever many times you feel like. And new polynomial functions	    with corresponding plots will be generated. \
\
NestedRadical.m is part 2 of the programming assignment.\
Simply run the file in MATLAB or Octave accordingly:\
	1. In the Workspace Window enter:\
		[n, nth_term] = NestedRadical(n)\
	     where n is the term in sequence you wish to iterate too. So for a_40, we would have\
		[n, nth_term] = NestedRadical(40)\
	2. The code will generate a corresponding plot as well.\
	3. The answers to the other questions of part 2 are included as comments in the code. \
